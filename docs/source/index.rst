A Digital Twin Component for Glaciers
=====================================

The **DTC Glaciers project (DTCG)** is developed for the European Space Agency’s Digital Twin Earth initiative, as part of the `Digital Twin Components Early Development Actions`_.

.. _Digital Twin Components Early Development Actions: https://eof.esa.int/early-dtc/

Leveraging the latest earth observation data, in-situ measurements, and advanced modelling techniques, DTC Glaciers aims to create a dynamic digital representation of mountain glaciers.
The digital twin is designed to be explored, interrogated, and informed in response to real-world events, new observations, and evolving scenarios.
This open and interactive platform will empower users and stakeholders to better understand the rapid changes in mountain glaciers and take informed action to address these challenges effectively.
